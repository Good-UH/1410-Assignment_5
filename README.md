Sorting elements in an array by ascending or descending order

Write a function called sortMe that sorts the elements of an array in nemerical order from highest to lowest values (descending order) or vice versa (ascending order).
sortMe does NOT re-arrange elements in the array; instead, it uses a second array, an array of indexes for the elements in the original array and then sortMe
sorts the second array based on the values in the original array A sorted version of the original array can then be produced with these sorted indexes.
mode 'a', function sorts in the ascending order, mode 'd' function sorts in the descending order.
